please use the following cmake options while running the cmake in the main folder:
```bash
foo@bar:~/LaserChess3D$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DASSIMP_BUILD_ASSIMP_TOOLS=OFF
foo@bar:~/LaserChess3D$ cmake --build ./cmake-build-release --target LaserChess3D -- -j 3
foo@bar:~/LaserChess3D$ cd /cmake-build-release
foo@bar:~/LaserChess3D/cmake-build-release$ chmod +x LaserChess3D
```
Run the game:
```
foo@bar:~/LaserChess3D/cmake-build-release$ ./LaserChess3D
```

you can also name the folder ./cmake-build-debug if this makes more sense for you.
The release version currently has a framerate bug on some systems.
```bash
foo@bar:~/LaserChess3D$ cmake --build ./cmake-build-debug --target LaserChess3D -- -j 3

  Shoots once, diagonally at any range.

The AI pieces:

Drone:

  Shoots once, diagonally at any range. 
  Attack power: 1 
  Hitpoints: 2 
  Behaviour: 
    Drones move before any other AI piece. 
    They must all move and attack if possible. 
    They must shoot at a target if possible after attempting to move 
    
Dreadnought:
  Moves 1 space in any direction: 
  Attacks all adjacent enemy units; 
  Attack power 2: 
  Hitpoints: 5 
  Behaviour: 
    Dreadnoughts move after all drones have moved. 
    It must move 1 space, if possible, and must move towards the nearest enemy unit. It must try to 
    attack after moving. 
    
Command Unit:
  The Command Unit must move after Dreadnoughts have moved. 
  It can only move 1space in two possible directions Â­ parallel to the AIs side of the board (i.e. it stays 
  the same distance from the enemy side of the board). 
  It cannot shoot or attack. 
  Attack power: 0 
  Hitpoints: 5 
  Behaviour: 
   It must avoid getting hit, if possible, so it must make the best move out of the three options available
